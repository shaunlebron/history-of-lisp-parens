# History of Lisp Editing

I'd like to find out how people tolerated parens back in the golden days of
Lisp. I have a feeling we might've forgotten some things that would be useful
today, or might influence some new ideas.

I started by working backwards from today (still filling in blanks):

- 2015 - [Parinfer]
- 2014 - [Lispy]
- 2012 - [Smartparens]
- 2005 - [Paredit] by [Taylor Campbell]
- 2001 - [DrScheme], now [DrRacket]
- ...
- 1987 - Interlisp SEdit (structure editor. full interactive display)
- 198? - Interlisp DEdit (display editor. clickable display + command window)
- 1983 - BBC LISP FEDIT (structure editor, based closely on PSL fedit)
- 1980 - IBM Lisp/VM Lispedit (display editor)
- 1980 - Zmacs - first structure commands for text editor
- 1980 - Portable Standard Lisp fedit/sedit (structure editor)
- 1979 - Nokolisp - screen-based editor
- ...
- 1967 - BBN (InterLisp) - (teletype structure editor)
- 196? - Standard Lisp fedit (structure editor)*
- 1966 - [PILOT] - first thesis on structure editing

## Standard Lisp/Portable Standard Lisp

Portable Standard Lisp, as used at Cambridge University in England and later
commercialised by Acornsoft, had a structure editor, entered as **sedit** for
editing arbitrary s-expressions or as **fedit** for editing functions. Whether
this feature existed in Portable Standard Lisp as used at Utah and other sites
is not known, but is probable, since it is understood that the Cambridge version
was a straight port. Similarly, it is not known whether this feature existed
in Standard Lisp prior to the 1980 release of Portable Standard Lisp, but again
it is probable, since the new feature in Portable Standard Lisp was the
Lisp-to-C compiler.

### Teletype Editor

__[Try it here!](running.md#interlisp-teletype)__

A command-line interface for editing s-expressions. Rather than displaying the
whole file, only one expression is displayed at a time—by printing after each
command.

- use `N` to go Nth child of current expression
- use `0` to go up to parent
- nested sub-expressions collapsed by default to `&`
- expand with `?`
- pretty-print with `pp`

Six paren commands can be performed on the current expression's children:

| Command | Name      | Mnemonic | Extra Inference                     |
|:--------|:----------|:---------|:------------------------------------|
| `BI`    | Both In   | `()+`    |                                     |
| `BO`    | Both Out  | `()-`    |                                     |
| `LI`    | Left In   | `(+`     | adds `)` at end                     |
| `LO`    | Left Out  | `(-`     | removes `)` and EVERYTHING AFTER IT |
| `RI`    | Right In  | `)<`     |                                     |
| `RO`    | Right Out | `)>`     |                                     |

```
(A B C D E F G H)

>(BI 3)
(A B (C) D E F G H)
     ^ ^ wrap parens around index 3
```

```
(A B C D E F G H)

>(BI 3 5)
(A B (C D E) F G H)
     ^     ^ wrap parens from index 3 to index 5

>(BO 3)
(A B _C D E_ F G H)
     ^     ^ unwrap parens around index 3
```

```
(A B C D E F G H)

>(LI 3)
(A B (C D E F G H))
     ^           ^ insert left-paren before index 3, and right-paren at end
```

```
(A B (C D E) F G H)

>(LO 3)
(A B _C D E_ _ _ _)
     ^     ^ ^ ^ ^ remove parens around index 3, and EVERYTHING AFTER IT
```

```
(A B (C D E F G H))

>(RI 3 2)
(A B (C D) E F G H_)
         ^ <----- ^ move right-paren of index 3 to inner index 2

>(RO 3)
(A B (C D_ E F G H))
         ^ -----> ^ move right-paren of index 3 to end
```

_See the 1967 [BBN Lisp System] section on "structure changing commands" page 49._


### DEdit

The display editor was a visual alternative to the teletype editor—click one or
two expressions in the pretty-print, then click a command to execute on those
expressions.

1. __pretty-print window__ (left) - click to select expressions (current=solid-lined, previous=dash-lined)
1. __command menu__ (right) - click to perform an operation on selections (current=arg1, previous=arg2)
1. __type-in window__ (below) - manually type an expression. when done, it becomes selected and clickable

![dedit-screen]

Clicking an expression while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>
_unreads_ it into the type-in window (pastes as text).

- __left click__ - select object
- __middle click__ - select containing list
- __right click__ - select lowest common ancestor with previous selection

| DEdit Paren Command | Initially Hidden?             | Teletype Command |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------|:-----------------|
| `()`                |                               | same as `BI`     |
| `( in`              | middle-click `()` to show     | same as `LI`     |
| `) in`              | middle-click `()` to show     | same as `RI`     |
| `() out`            |                               | same as `BO`     |
| `( out`             | middle-click `() out` to show | same as `LO`     |
| `) out`             | middle-click `() out` to show | same as `RO`     |

_See the 1985 [Interlisp-D Reference Manual Volume II: Environment], Chapter 16
page 407._

### SEdit

__[Try it here!](running.md#interlisp-sedit)__

SEdit later replaced DEdit as the default visual structure editor for Interlisp.
It allowed the user to type directly into the pretty-printed view, and did away
with the separate type-in window from DEdit. It may look closer to a normal text
editor we're used to, but...

[![sedit-screen]][sedit-video]

Though it appears to be a normal modern text editor, it still has the
constraints of an auto-formatted structure editor. To give the user the most
freedom within these constraints, a very interesting language was crafted around
the mouse, allowing it to interact with the structure in a way I can only
describe as _vim-like_.  See my take on documenting its unique [caret states and
selection types].

[caret states and selection types]:sedit-caret-selection.md

After seeing this novel mouse behavior, I can see why most paren commands from
DEdit and teletype editor were removed in SEdit. The mouse primitives work well
with just the simplest paren commands (wrap/unwrap), exposed as hotkeys:

| Hotkey   | Name         | Description                                     |
|:---------|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Meta-`(` | Parenthesize | wraps selection in a list. places `▲` after `(` |
| Meta-`)` | Parenthesize | wraps selection in a list. places `▲` after `)` |
| Meta-`/` | Extract      | unwraps selected list, string, or quote         |

Normal insertions, deletions, and clicking of parens have the following
behavior:

| Paren Operation  | Description                                                     |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type `(`         | inserts `()` with `▲` inside                                    |
| Type `)`         | nothing inserted. places `▲` after next `)`. selects whole list |
| Backspace at `(` | removes list if empty, else no-op                               |
| Backspace at `)` | nothing deleted. places `▲` before `)`                          |
| Middle-click `(` | selects list. places `▲` on clicked side of `(`                 |
| Middle-click `)` | selects list. places `▲` on clicked side of `)`                 |

## ZMacs

ZMacs in 1980 is [reported](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10548242) to be
the first text editor with balanced parentheses commands. The 1987 [ZMacs
Editor Reference] shows them on page 209 (3-137):


## Lispedit

> I must say that I wish I could use LISP/VM again, and Martin's editor. I've
> always felt it gave me the best interface, with the highest productivity, of any
> editor I've ever used for LISP.
> —[Cyril N. Alberga](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/D2Q5t8IEOkg/EjgB3XBP8hQJ)

> An important feature of Lispedit is a program display that shows the structure
> of a Lisp expression from the point of view of a selected sub-expression.  The
> sub-expression, called the _focus_, is shown high-lighted and its relationship
> to the surrounding context is shown by automatically generated indentation.
> Selected components of the focus and its context are elided (shown as '...') in

> —[Interactive program execution in Lispedit]

There are no surviving images of what Lispedit looked like.  But reconstructing
from descriptions:

## Nokolisp

In 1979, [Nokolisp]'s editor was added as the author's reaction to the first
Interlisp teletype editor, to see what it might look like as a screen-based
editor.

Rather than conventional pretty-printing seen in later screen-based editors,
Nokolisp's editor displayed a subexpression on each line, allowing you to
move a cursor line-by-line to select one to operate on. For example:

```
0> fib

(lambda
 (x)
 (if
  (< x 2)
  x
  (+ (fib (1- x)) (fib (- x 2)))))

1> (edit fib)
```

This would bring up the following view:

```
(                                 BOOT fib 0 0
_ lambda
  (x)
  (if (< x 2) x &)
)
```

(Notice `&` elides the long expression for fitting.)

The `_` cursor is initially on the first line. If we move `_` down to the third
line, we can select and focus it to see our next view:

```
(                                 BOOT fib 1 0
_ if
  (< x 2)
  x
  (+ (fib (1- x)) (fib (- x 2)))
)
```

I believe the `BOOt fib 1 0` is a status line indicating your position in the
root expression.

Paren commands are letters (need to verify):

| Paren Command | Description                     |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------|
| `a`           | wrap in parens                  |
| `r`           | remove parens                   |
| `w`           | extend paren to next expression |
| `c`           | push last element out of paren  |

## Maclisp

(preferred formatted ASCII files over data structures for programs)

## Debating Maclisp vs Interlisp (i.e. storing code as text vs structure)

A discussion/debate from 1978 that reveals a lot about how people thought about
text vs structure when storing and displaying their code:

[Programming in an Interactive Environment: the Lisp Experience](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220566511_Programming_in_an_Interactive_Environment_the_LISP_Experience)

- response by Richard Stallman arguing for text: https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/surveyor-s-forum-structured-editing-with-a-lisp-PzoXAz9GCu?impressionId=594bfe8baf9dc&i_medium=mydeepdyve&i_campaign=recommendations&i_source=recommendations
- author's reply: https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/surveyor-s-forum-structured-editing-with-a-lisp-mQNqMU2je0?impressionId=594c0f05171ea&i_medium=docview&i_campaign=recommendations&i_source=recommendations
- a much later followup discussing how structured editing died: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.lisp/D2Q5t8IEOkg/AqbNfOxZgUIJ
  - Maclisp killed it because they wanted custom layout of code and comments

This is so far my favorite summary of this topic from 1997.  (too many great
points to list).

### Researching methods

started from [Paredit credits], (could not locate `sedit.el`):

> The original inspirations for paredit were Interlisp-D's structure
> editor 'SEdit' -- a real structure editor, not a cheesy imitation like
> paredit -- and Guillaume Germain's sedit.el for GNU Emacs.

- finding mailing list discussions
- looking for official reference manuals of lisp machines
- using [deepdyve] to find articles
- asking around
