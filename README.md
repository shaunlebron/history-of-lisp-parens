# History of Lisp Parentheses

A historical look at the many attempts to improve Lisp's most notorious
artifactâ€”_parentheses_.

I'd like to find out how people tolerated parens back in the golden days of
Lisp. I have a feeling we might've forgotten some things that would be useful
today, or might influence some new ideas.


Roughly, we cover the history in four parts:

1. [Why Parens?](why-parens.md)
1. [Editors](editors.md)
1. [Alternative Syntaxes](alt-syntax.md)
1. [Visual Decorations](decorations.md)
